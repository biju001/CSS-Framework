## Simple and Easy CSS Framework

This CSS framework aims to provide a straightforward and user-friendly approach to styling your web projects. It consists of several key components:

1. **reset.css**: This file is based on Eric Meyer's reset.css and helps normalize browser styles.

2. **base.css**: While not recommended for extensive modifications, this file offers basic styling options for adjusting colors, fonts, widths, and spacing as needed.

3. **Container and Section Classes**: The default wrapper class is `container`, which enforces a maximum width of 1200px and 100% width for your content. If you require full-width sections, use the `section` class. You can customize the website width by making changes here.

4. **Grid System**: We provide a flexible 12-column grid system and two types of grids. The first has a 4% left margin, excluding the 1st column. The second is a 0% margin 12-column grid.

   - For the 4% grid, use classes like `two.columns`, `ten.columns`, etc.
   - For the 0% grid, use classes like `six.nmcolumns`, etc.

5. **Float Classes**: We offer separate classes for floating elements left (`fl`) and right (`fr`).

6. **Zebra Table Styling**: Apply the `table-content` class to a `div` and then insert your table code inside the `div` to enable zebra table styling.

7. **Clearing Child Elements**: To clear child elements, you can use either the `clearfix` class or the `cls` class.

We hope this framework simplifies your CSS work and enhances your web development experience.
